# CDC2018

## Basic Infrastructure
* Start a virtual environment in the project directory
    * `python -m venv env/`
* Install dependencies
    * `pip install -r requirements.txt`
    * make sure that pip is installing the python3 modules, and not python2
    * If you have additional things we need, add to this
    
## Installing so you can import stuff across the project
* Install project in your virtual environment
    * `python setup.py install`
